// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Take a number as input (let's call it 'num')
If num % 2 equals 0:
	Output: Display "num is even"
Else:
     Output: Display "num is odd"



// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

variables: sum = 0, average = 0, minimum = infinity, maximum = -infinity
Repeat the following steps 5 times:
   a. Input: Take a number as input (let's call it 'currentNumber')
   b. Add 'currentNumber' to 'sum'
   c. If 'currentNumber' is less than 'minimum', update 'minimum' to 'currentNumber'
   d. If 'currentNumber' is greater than 'maximum', update 'maximum' to 'currentNumber'
Calculate the average: average = sum / 5
	Output: Display "Average of the 5 numbers is: average"
	Output: Display "Minimum of the 5 numbers is: minimum"
	Output: Display "Maximum of the 5 numbers is: maximum"
